# Hybridflow


### Features


## Building Hybridflow from Source

Prerequisites for building Hybridflow:


## Developing Hybridflow

The Hybridflow committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Hybridflow codebase.
We recommend IntelliJ IDEA for developing projects that involve Java code.

Minimal requirements for an IDE are:
* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)
* Support for Maven with Java and Scala


### IntelliJ IDEA

The IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development.

* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)
